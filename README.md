HackMizzou Project

This is the project made by Peter Dirks, Greg Highland, and Robert Stovall. 
The point of this project is to connect hardware inputs to an Arduino, then use the inputs given from the Arduino to order a pizza.
The Arduino sends binary to the computer, then using the the given inputs we choose a path for Selinium to take in the browser to order a pizza.
